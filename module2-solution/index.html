                <p>
                  Mercury is the first planet from the Sun and the smallest 
                  in the Solar System. It is a terrestrial planet with a heavily 
                  cratered surface due to overlapping impact events. These features
                  are well preserved since the planet has no geological activity and
                  an extremely tenuous atmosphere called an exosphere.

                <p>
                    Venus is the second planet from the Sun.
                  It is a rocky planet with the densest atmosphere of all the rocky 
                  bodies in the Solar System, and the only one with a mass and size that is
                  close to that of its orbital neighbor Earth. Orbiting inferiorly (inside of Earth's orbit), 
                  it appears in Earth's sky always close to the Sun, as either a "morning star" or an "evening star". 
                  While this is also true for Mercury, Venus appears much more prominently,
                  since it is the third brightest object in Earth's sky after the Moon and the Sun

                <p>
                    Mars is the fourth planet and the furthest terrestrial planet
                  from the Sun. The reddish color of its surface is due to finely-grained iron(III)
                  oxide dust in the soil, giving it the nickname "the Red Planet".
